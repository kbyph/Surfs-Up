# Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of Project
An investor wants to learn more about the weather for the months of June and December in Oahu, HI. His main concern involves the surf shop's year-round sustainability and harsh weather conditions that may possibly force the store to close frequently. To analyze Hawaii's weather data, we must retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June & December, convert the data into a list, create a Dataframe, and generate the summary statistics.

## Resources
- Software:
  - Python
  - Flask
  - SQLite
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Git Bash
  
## Results
The following table summarizes June's temperature statistics:

The following table summarizes Decembers temperature statistics:

According to the data between both tables, we can see that:
- The average temperature in June is around 74 degrees, whereas in December, we expect cooler air throughout the 71 degrees range.
- The coolest temperature each month would expect averages out to around 64 degrees in June, and 56 degrees in December.
- The highest temperature maximizes at around 85 degrees in June, and 83 degrees in December.

## Summary
In summary, the temperature in Oahu is relatively the same throughout the year. Due to low rainfall and very similar temperatures, it would be very ideal for the investor to open up his surf shop in Hawaii. Additional queries that could be run may include precipation rates in June and December, as well as a comaparison by weather stations located throughout the island for a more specific weather pattern across each region.
